Vision & Mission:
Our Vision:
We see chess beyond the board—a pursuit that fosters personal growth and social transformation. Like life, chess is about the challenges, triumphs and continuous learning. With over 20 years of collective experience, our team has witnessed the evolution of chess and understands what it takes to drive its future development. Recognizing the vast and largely untapped potential of chess in Karnataka, we are committed to cultivating an environment where the sport can flourish and inspire a broader cultural renaissance. At the heart of our vision lies the conviction that CHESS IS FOR EVERYONE, and our endeavours are to spread its values far and wide, uniting communities and empowering individuals across all walks of life.
 
Our Plan-of-action: (to be done like a flow-chat or using infographics)
We have structured our plan of action around three core focus areas.
Socio-chess activities: We perceive Chess as a tool for social connection. Through innovative formats, outreach events, and interactive sessions, we aim to break barriers and bring chess to a wider audience.
Bengaluru: A global chess hub: Our vision is to transform Bengaluru into a world-class centre for chess. By organizing elite tournaments, strengthening grassroots programs, and building strategic alliances, we are paving the way for the city to become a key player on the global chess map.
Women in Chess: Our initiatives are designed to inspire women to pursue chess professionally and emerge as new champions in the field. We are dedicated to empowering female talent by providing specialized mentorship, and competitive opportunities.
