We strive to make chess more accessible through well-structured tournaments, coaching camps, and interactive learning formats that engage both aspiring and seasoned players. In parallel, we work towards strengthening the sport by collaborating with sports organizations to enhance infrastructure, identify and support emerging talents, and elevate competitive standards through training, scholarships, and public outreach.
Beyond conventional boundaries, the Trust envisions chess as more than just a sport—it is a powerful tool for intellectual and social enrichment. By forging meaningful connections between chess and diverse fields such as education, commerce, and technology, we aim to unlock new opportunities and broaden the game’s reach. Through strategic collaborations and public engagement, we aspire to create an ecosystem where chess is not only a competitive pursuit but also a bridge to innovation, learning, and community development.
